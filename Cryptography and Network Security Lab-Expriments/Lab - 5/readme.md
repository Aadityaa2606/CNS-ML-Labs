# MD5 Hashing Algorithm

The MD5 hashing algorithm accepts inputs of varying lengths and produces a fixed-size output of 128 bits.

## Inputs

The input to the MD5 hashing algorithm can be:

- Exactly 448 bits, which is equivalent to 56 characters.
- Less than 448 bits, which is less than 56 characters.
- More than 448 bits, which is more than 56 characters.

## Outputs

The output from the MD5 hashing algorithm can be:

- 1 block of 64 rounds.
- 2 blocks of 64 rounds each.
- More than 2 blocks, each of 64 rounds.
