# MD5 Hashing Algorithm: 

The MD5 hashing algorithm accepts inputs of varying lengths and produces a fixed-size output of 128 bits.

## Working of the MD5 Algorithm

The MD5 hashing algorithm works in the following way:

1. **Padding**: The input message is padded to make its length a multiple of 512 bits.
2. **Initialization**: The MD5 algorithm initializes four 32-bit variables.
3. **Processing**: The input message is processed in 16-word blocks.
4. **Output**: The final output is a 128-bit message digest.


## Inputs

Sample inputs to the MD5 hashing algorithm can be:

- Exactly 448 bits, which is equivalent to 56 characters.
- Less than 448 bits, which is less than 56 characters.
- More than 448 bits, which is more than 56 characters.

## Outputs

The output from the MD5 hashing algorithm can be:

- 1 block of 64 rounds.
- 2 blocks of 64 rounds each.
- More than 2 blocks, each of 64 rounds.

## Pseudocode

The following pseudocode describes the working of the MD5 hashing algorithm:

```plaintext
MD5 (message)
  Initialize variables
  Append padding bits
  Process the message in 16-word blocks
  Output the message digest
```

## Example

Consider the following input message:

```plaintext
"Hello, World!"
```
